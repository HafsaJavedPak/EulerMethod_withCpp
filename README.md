### Euler Method Using C++

#### Euler Method
Euler Method is usually a introductory topic in a Differential Equations or Numerical Analysis Course. It is used to find out the points which satsisfy the solution of a given differential equation and initial point. The points can then be plotted to study the behavior of the solution.

#### Note
- In order to run the code, GNU plot must be installed on the user's system and set as a enviromental variable.
- In order to chane the differential equation and thus change the graph of the solution, the mathematical expression in the `slope` function in the `EulerMethod.h` file must be changed.
- Euler Method does have its limitations.
